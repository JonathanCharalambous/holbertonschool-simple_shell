.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is executed through the file 'hsh'. It has the exact same output and error as sh (/bin/sh) and functions as a basic shell - where the shell is able to read user input, parse it and execute the command.
.P
.B 'hsh' 
can be used interactively and non-interactively. 
.br
When used interactively, commands can be executed using the enter key and will appear and end in a new line. A prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed and will wait for the user to type a command. Interactive mode can be exited using the command 'exit' or 'ctrl+c'.
.br
When used non-interactively, commands must be piped into the executable file 'hsh'. 
.P
simple_shell is able to handle simple command lines with arguments as well as handle the PATH and implement the 'env' built in.
Simple commands such as '/bin/ls' , 'echo' and 'ls' are supported.
.P
Return: Exit status of the last executed command
